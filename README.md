A collection of Project Euler solutions written in Racket/Scheme

This is here as a reference, and admittedly there might be some shoddy/incomplete code here - Racket was my first programming language and these Project Euler problems were some of my earliest experiences with programming.

Feel free to make whatever use you can out of these.

Some of these may have HackerRank functions associated with them - these were for HackerRank's project euler submissions where the problems were generalized to any input. No need to copy those for simple project euler solutions.

No external or internal libraries were used.

Racket is cancer.
